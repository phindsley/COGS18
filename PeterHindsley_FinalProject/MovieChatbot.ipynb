    "# Final Project - Movie Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Code modified and added to from the A3-Chatbot assignment. \n",
    "This is a chatbot that talks about different movie topics. It is able to talk about a range of different movie topics\n",
    "including: Movies, Actors/Actresses, Trivia, Quotes, and Reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user chooses:\n",
    "\n",
    " • Movies - they will be asked what their favorite genre is followed by their favorite movie in that genre. The four genres that the chatbot is coded for are Comedy, Horror/Thriller, SciFi, and Action (5 if you count the chatbot being coded to not want to discuss romance movies). If their favorite movie is the same as the chatbots', the chatbot will agree and give them a quote from the movie\n",
    " \n",
    " • Actors/Actresses - they will be asked who their favorite actor/actress is. They will get different responses if they have the same favorite as the chatbot or if their favorite is in the list of other actors. \n",
    " \n",
    " • Trivia - they will be asked trivia questions about movies. If they answer correctly they can either move on to the next one or talk about something else. If they answer incorrectly they can try again, move on, or talk about another topic.\n",
    " \n",
    " • Quotes - the chatbot will ask the user if they want to see a randomly generated quote. If they say yes, a random movie quote will appear. If they say no, they will be asked about one of the other topics (movies, trivia, etc.)\n",
    " \n",
    " • Reviews - the chatbot will give them a link to current RottenTomatoes reviews and ask them what they think. \n",
    " \n",
    "*The chatbots' responses to questions and unknown inputs are designed to steer the user back to the topics that the chatbot is coded for."
